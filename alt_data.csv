"Image of bright eight-pointed stars scattered across a dense orange-brown 
undulating cloudscape below a deep blue starscape."
"A blue-and-white sphere against a black background is somewhat reminiscent 
of the famous “Blue Marble” picture of Earth from space. With fuzzy, 
diffuse edges, this sphere features darker blue patches in most of the 
northern hemisphere facing the viewer. One, large, crescent-shaped, white 
patch extends along left side of the southern hemisphere facing the viewer, 
and a larger, blobby, white patch covers the middle latitudes of the right 
side of the southern hemisphere. Lighter blue regions border these white 
patches in the south."
"Four square panels appear in a horizontal strip. The first features a 
blue-and-white sphere against a black background, reminiscent of the “Blue 
Marble” picture of Earth. With fuzzy edges, this sphere has darker blue 
patches in the northern hemisphere and two large white patches in the 
southern hemisphere. Below it is the label: “Europa (NIRCam).” Each of the 
second, third, and fourth panels has a pixelated, roughly circular image of 
small, white, blue, or orange squares. The orange or blue squares appear in 
various shades. Several squares are a mix of both orange and blue. In each 
of these panels, there are slight variations in the arrangement of the 
colored squares. In the second panel, the label below the image reads: 
“Crystalline C O 2 ice at 2.7 microns.” In the third panel, the label below 
the image reads: “Crystalline C O 2 ice at 4.27 microns.” In the fourth 
panel, the label below the image reads: “Complex C O 2 ice at 4.25 
microns.” See the extended description for more details."
"At the center is a thin horizontal pinkish cloud known as Herbig-Haro 211 
that is uneven with rounded ends, and tilted from bottom left to top right. 
It takes up about two-thirds of the length of this angle, but is thinner 
and longer at the opposite angle. At its center is a dark spot. On either 
side of the dark spot, there are orangish-yellow wisps that extend to light 
blue wisps. Within the center of those clouds, a pink fluffy streak runs 
through each lobe. At the ends of each lobe, pink becomes the dominant 
color. The lobe to the left is fatter. The right lobe is thinner, and ends 
in a smaller pink semi-circle. Just off the edge of this lobe is a slightly 
smaller pink semicircle, then a pink sponge-like blob. The background 
contains several bright stars, each with eight diffraction spikes extending 
out from the central bright point."
"A large galaxy takes up the entirety of the image. The galaxy has a bright 
white core, and several large spiral arms extending out from that core, 
rotating clockwise. The arms are light blue with many pink speckles and 
clumps littering the arms. The background is also filled with a smattering 
of white and pink dots."

"A supernova. The center of the image contains a dense green cloud, shaped 
like a keyhole. Within this keyhole, there is a dark spot, composed of even 
denser gas. Outside of this cloud of gas is a ring of dense orange gas and 
dust that becomes more diffused as it travels further away from the center. 
The innermost part of this dense orange ring contains brighter orange 
clumps of glowing gas. Outside of these structures, both above and below 
them, are very faint orange rings of gas and dust. There are several bright 
white stars, three of which show an eight-pronged diffraction pattern 
brought about by the Webb Space Telescope. Several other white stars are 
strewn throughout the image."

glowing dust cave, with one streamer curling down the right-hand side. The 
dark shadow of the cloud appears pinched in the center, with light emerging 
in a triangle shape above and below the pinch, revealing the presence of a 
star inside the dark cloud. The image’s largest jets of red material 
emanate from within this dark cloud, thick and displaying structure like

accompanied by several narrow, faint rings— 2 thinner, crisper rings and 2 
broader, fainter rings.There are 6 tiny white dots, some floating among the

nanometers, corresponding to the right-most portion of Ultraviolet, all of 
the Visible, and the left-most sliver of Infrared. James Webb Space 
Telescope has a wavelength range of 600 to 28,500 nanometers, corresponding 
to a sliver of red visible light and the left half of Infrared. Spitzer 
Space Telescope has a wavelength range of 3,000 to 160,000 nanometers, 
corresponding to the right half of Infrared. Click View Description for

Galaxy Cluster Abell 2744
"This ray diagram, which traces the path that light takes, illustrates how 
light from a distant galaxy or star can be bent by the gravity of an 
intervening galaxy cluster."
Reflection Nebula IC 2631
"A simulated spectrum from the Webb telescope illustrates the molecules that 
may be detected in star-forming regions like the Eagle Nebula. It shows a 
spectrum plotted on a graph of brightness of light on the vertical y-axis 
versus wavelength of light in microns on the horizontal x-axis."
